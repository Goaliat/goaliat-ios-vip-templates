# VIP Xcode Templates

Xcode templates based on [Clean Swift](https://clean-swift.com) for generating Swift source code in View Interactor Presenter architecture.

## Description

These templates are based on the excellent Xcode templates from [Clean Swift](https://clean-swift.com) but modified based on our experiences and personal preferences as described in the next section.

## Setup

To install the Xcode templates you can run the shell script:

```
    sh install_templates.sh
```

## Usage

To generate a new VIP module (scene), in Xcode go to File > New File and select from the `Goaliat VIP Templates` section.

Give a name to your scene e.g. `TaskList` and it will generate all related files using this name as a prefix for your source code files.
